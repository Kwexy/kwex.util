A discord bot with utilities made by KwexyðŸ¤–ðŸ”§

I always get people messaging me on discord asking me to open the minecraft server while I'm at work. I have no problem taking a break from working to start it up, but I thought it would be cool to make a command for the discord bot that would do it for me.

```
/start
```
