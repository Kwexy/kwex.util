# **kwex.util**
A [Discord](https://discord.com) bot with utilities made by KwexyðŸ¤–ðŸ”§

**kwex.util** doesn't have any fancy music players or anything like that. This bot is a learning experience and is focused on automating and problem solving tools.

## Features:

I always get people messaging me on discord asking me to open the minecraft server while I'm at work. I have no problem taking a break from working to start it up, but I thought it would be cool to make a command for the discord bot that would do it for me.

```
/start
```
