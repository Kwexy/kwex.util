# **kwex.util**
A [Discord](https://discord.com) bot with utilities made by KwexyðŸ¤–ðŸ”§

I always get people messaging me on discord asking me to open the minecraft server while I'm at work, so I thought it would be cool to make a discord bot that allows friends to open the server through discord.

**kwex.util** doesn't have any fancy music players or anything like that. This bot is a learning experience and is focused on automating and problem solving tools. Don't worry, **kwex.util** doesn't have a mind of its own:brain:

## Features:
```
%start
```
Starts the server. Server takes about 30 seconds to fully open.

```
%close
```
Closes the server. Server takes about 30 seconds to fully close.

```
%restart
```
Restarts the server. Server takes about 1 minute to fully restart.

```
%kill
```
Kills the *BOT*, not the server. Using this command (which I included solely for debugging purposes), closes the process itself.
